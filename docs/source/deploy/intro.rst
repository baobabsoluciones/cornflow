Before you begin
--------------------

Follow these steps to install the necessary tools:

#. Install `Docker Community Edition (CE) <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>`_ on your workstation. Depending on the OS, you may need to configure your Docker instance to use 4.00 GB of memory for all containers to run properly. Please refer to the Resources section if using Docker for Windows or Docker for Mac for more information.
#. Install `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_ and newer on your workstation.

Older versions of docker-compose do not support all features required by the `docker-compose.yml` file, so double check that it meets the minimum version requirements.
