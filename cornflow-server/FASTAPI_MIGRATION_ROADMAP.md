# Cornflow FastAPI Migration Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for migrating the Cornflow REST API from Flask to FastAPI while maintaining all core functionalities and ensuring backward compatibility.

## Core Functionalities to Preserve

1. Automatic database migrations (Alembic)
2. Request data validation (Pydantic)
3. Response data validation (Pydantic)
4. Authentication (JWT/OAuth)
5. Python package deployment
6. CLI functionality
7. API extensibility

## Phase 1: Project Structure Setup

- [ ] Create `cornflow_fastapi` directory
- [ ] Set up basic FastAPI application structure
- [ ] Configure development environment
- [ ] Set up testing infrastructure

### Directory Structure

```
cornflow_fastapi/
├── app/
│   ├── api/
│   │   └── v1/
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── config.py
│   │   ├── security.py
│   │   └── dependencies.py
│   ├── db/
│   │   ├── base.py
│   │   └── session.py
│   ├── models/
│   ├── schemas/
│   └── services/
├── tests/
├── alembic/
├── cli/
└── main.py
```

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure Migration

- [ ] Database Configuration

  - [ ] Migrate SQLAlchemy setup
  - [ ] Configure Alembic for migrations
  - [ ] Set up database session management

- [ ] Authentication System

  - [ ] Implement JWT authentication
  - [ ] Set up OAuth integration
  - [ ] Migrate user management

- [ ] Data Validation
  - [ ] Convert Marshmallow schemas to Pydantic
  - [ ] Implement request/response models
  - [ ] Set up validation middleware

## Phase 3: API Endpoints Migration

- [ ] Core Endpoints

  - [ ] User management
  - [ ] Authentication
  - [ ] Permissions

- [ ] Business Logic Endpoints
  - [ ] Data models
  - [ ] Solvers
  - [ ] Instances
  - [ ] Solutions

## Phase 4: CLI and Package Management

- [ ] CLI Migration

  - [ ] User management commands
  - [ ] Migration commands
  - [ ] Service management

- [ ] Package Configuration
  - [ ] Update setup.py
  - [ ] Configure dependencies
  - [ ] Set up entry points

## Phase 5: Testing Strategy

- [ ] Unit Tests

  - [ ] Model tests
  - [ ] Service tests
  - [ ] API endpoint tests

- [ ] Integration Tests

  - [ ] Database integration
  - [ ] Authentication flow
  - [ ] API workflow

- [ ] Performance Tests
  - [ ] Load testing
  - [ ] Response time benchmarks

## Phase 6: Documentation and Deployment

- [ ] API Documentation

  - [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger setup
  - [ ] API documentation
  - [ ] Usage examples

- [ ] Deployment
  - [ ] Docker configuration
  - [ ] CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Production deployment guide

## Migration Strategy

1. **Parallel Development**: Maintain both Flask and FastAPI versions during migration
2. **Incremental Migration**: Migrate one endpoint at a time, ensuring tests pass
3. **Feature Parity**: Ensure all existing features work before adding new ones
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain API compatibility where possible

## Testing Approach

1. **Test-First Development**: Write tests before implementing features
2. **Continuous Integration**: Run tests on every commit
3. **Feature Comparison**: Compare behavior between Flask and FastAPI versions
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare response times and resource usage

## Dependencies to Add

```txt
fastapi>=0.104.0
uvicorn>=0.24.0
pydantic>=2.4.2
python-jose[cryptography]>=3.3.0
passlib[bcrypt]>=1.7.4
python-multipart>=0.0.6
```

## Timeline Estimation

- Phase 1: 1 week
- Phase 2: 2 weeks
- Phase 3: 3 weeks
- Phase 4: 1 week
- Phase 5: 2 weeks
- Phase 6: 1 week

Total estimated time: 10 weeks

## Next Steps

1. Set up the basic FastAPI project structure
2. Configure the development environment
3. Begin with core infrastructure migration
4. Start with a simple endpoint as proof of concept
