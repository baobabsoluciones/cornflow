External endpoints
-------------------------------
On this folder you can add external endpoints that will be merged with the rest of Cornflow endpoints.

The structure should be the same as any other endpoint. 

For updating the database accordingly, the following commands should be done::

    flask db migrate

    flask db upgrade
